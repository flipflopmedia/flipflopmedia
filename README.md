- 👋 Howdy! I’m @flipflopmedia (non-alias, Tracy). I am a freelance designer/developer, working under my biz name "flip-flop media", and have been designing and developing for the internet platform since the dawn of web sites! The flip-flop media MOTO, “-design with you in mind”
- 👀 I’m interested in creating visual movement through my art to move you. With a vast array of approached methods and delivery... where the determined outcome is determined by your perception, your emotion and your interaction... each piece uniquely presented, yet taking on new meaning and opposing definition in its reach and destination… where art has no ending… no final piece… no completion… because it lives on… breathes new definition… new emotion… and a new view to you who view it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... yes, always, and all that I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything pertaining to art and designing for the internet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
